            <p>Michael Womack is a student of life, always striving to learn and become a better human. Michael has been working
                in restaurants and bars for the last 10 years. He is currently taking a huge step in self-development by
                taking the UCLA Full-Stack coding Bootcamp. Starting this journey with minimal experience in coding is both
                exciting and little scary for him. One of his biggest motivations to work though the challenges of the course
                is his strong desire for a career change.
            </p>

            <p>One of his favorite things to do when he isn't working is traveling with his camera and exploring other cultures.
                His most recent trip was a six week backpacking adventure in 2017 to Indonesia and Thailand. He saw wild
                orangutans in the jungles of Sumatra, visited ancient holy temples in Java and relaxed on remote beaches
                in Lombok and Bali.
